# The power of open science *(template for you to play with)*

*These [Google slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CsoBX3LwU8r5_34nuzthO9bn8xLxZMmL6-uY-yUaRTs/edit?usp=sharing) are from a 60-minute guest lecture about open science, the Ocean Health Index, and Openscapes. The audience was Professor Claudia Tyler's Conservation Ecology EEMB 168 course at UCSB on March 7, 2019.*

Have you noticed the `[]()` pattern to make links in Markdown? Put words to hyperlink in `[]` and the URL in `()`. 

I also talked about GitHub for science â€“ and can include an image with the same format, but note the preceding exclamation point: `![]()` (From the browser, you'll need an image with an existing url).
